    "## What is Jupyter?\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is a way to combine text (with math!) and code (which runs and can display graphic output!) in an easy-to-read document that renders in a web browser.  The notebook itself is stored as a text file in [JSON](http://json.org) format.  This text file is what you will email the course instructor when submitting your homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is language agnostic as its name suggests.  The name \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a new language for scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (which you know and love, or at least will when the course is over), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (the dominant tool for statistical computation).  However, you currently can run over 40 different languages in a Jupyter notebook, not just Julia, Python, and R."

You can also navigate around the files on your computer to find a file you wish to edit by clicking the \"Upload\" button in the upper right corner.  You can also click \"New\" in the upper right corner to get a new Jupyter notebook.  After selecting the file you wish to edit, it will appear in a new window in your browser, beautifully formatted and ready to edit. (\"Jupyter Lab\" is slightly different from \"Jupyter Notebook.) "

    "A Jupyter notebook consists of **cells**.  The two main types of cells you will use are **code cells** and **markdown cells**, and we will go into their properties in depth momentarily.  First, an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **code cell** contains actual code that you want to run.  You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook.  Or, you can  hit `esc` and then `y` (denoted \"`esc, y`\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit \"`shift + enter`.\"  Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are now known to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown cells** contain text.  The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language.  You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly.  As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text.  Hitting \"`shift + enter`\" renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting \"`esc, m`\" in the cell.  Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can use the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar.  The shortcut to insert a cell below is \"`esc, b`\" and to insert a cell above is \"`esc, a`.\"  Alternatively, you  can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting \"`alt + enter`.\" There is another shot cut, \"`ctrl+enter`\", which execute a cell but not add a new line below. In order to switch an existing code or markdown cell into editing mode, just double clik the cell to edit it.   "

This is run off of a remote server, so if you are not connected to the internet, your equations will not be rendered.  You will use $\\LaTeX$ extensively in preparation of your assignments.  There are plenty of resources on the internet for getting started with $\\LaTeX$, but you will only need a tiny subset of its functionality in your assignments, and **Tutorial 2**, plus cheat sheets you may find by Google (such as [this one](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet-a4.pdf)) are useful."
